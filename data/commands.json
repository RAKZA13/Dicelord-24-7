The Prince – Nathaniel Farrell, The Sheriff – Lowell Dalton\n**Recap:**\nThe day of the initiation of the coterie. Everyone was left to their own devices for the first part of the night. On the way to the ceremony Zeferet stumbled upon the cat emporium cafe, and unknowingly trespassed on Ceilican (Werecat) territory. He managed to barely avoid a fight. \nThe coterie was formed, and properly introduced to the Camarilla, the Sheriff was assigned as Shadow (with his childer as stand-in if he was busy). They mingled a bit, and after a while Max, chose to ride with an Italian character a certain meeting. Here he met with another curious character, and asked him for something, which he complied, giving him two metal flasks. \nIn the meanwhile, the Sheriff (Lowell Dalton) had approached Elizabeth about the coterie “meeting” about the assignment the coterie had been activated for. She started tracking down her coterie quickly realizing Max was missing, and that Steffi had tried going after him. Result being a combination of Cedrics premonition (Auspex) and Zeferet’s hacking skills, they tracked him down, seemingly coming out from, or at least in the area of, the forbidden area. \nThey arrived back at seemingly annoyed Sheriff and a nervous Zeferet, however, the Sheriff had been talked somewhat down by a call from the Italian guy from earlier. He quickly went over their assignment; investigating a possible Masquerade breach. He gave them the aide of his personal contact from within the police; Detective Shane Well, before hastily going on to his next meeting. \nSession ended by the coterie asking about Max’s questionable actions.","name":"Set Embed Description"},{"storage":"2","varName":"Session1","channel":"0","varName2":"","name":"Send Embed Message"}]},{"name":"Session2","permissions":"NONE","restriction":"1","actions":[{"title":"**#2: Interrogation**","author":"","color":"#ffa600","timestamp":"false","url":"","authorIcon":"","imageUrl":"","thumbUrl":"","storage":"2","varName":"Session2","name":"Create Embed Message"},{"storage":"2","varName":"Session2","message":"**Yield:** 4xp\n**Gametime:** 21 PM Spring time, Monday. \n**Session time:** 2-3 hours\n**People Encountered:** The Detective - Shane Well\n**Recap:**\nSetting up a meeting with Detective Well, on the phone were first Zeferet then Elizabeth. They set up the meeting 30 min from “now” at a nearby Hotel, in a suite Elizabeth bought for the night. The coterie arrived first. Once Well showed up they asked him information about the case, and he gave them what he knew about the two victims; Casper Drum and Don Ellard (see victim entries). However, the coterie did manage to both spook the Detective and make a smaller ruckus at the hotel, they did manage to handle it without much trouble (Dominate). Zeferet’s poking around in the Detective’s papers did get noticed by “someone” though (Ceilicans). They did manage to find the victims addresses, and with a little help from the Detective figure out Mr. Ellard might have been involved in cooking (and selling?) ecstasy in his basement. \nWith only a few hours left until sunup, the coterie decided to follow their leads the following day; splitting up. \nCedric and Max went to where the 2nd victim had been found to search for clues, but aside from a little blood, came up empty-handed. Max then went out to hunt causing a bar fight and getting himself drunk amongst other things. Elizabeth went to the firing range to train her shooting (Firearms 2). Zeferet went home to take revenge on Max, by sabotaging his favourite gallery “the Hot Zone” digitally. At last Steffi too, went to a bar causing a ruckus, training his fighting skill. \nSession ended by waking up the next night. Max having extra Rouse checks, landed on **Hunger 4**.

The interrogation group managed to heavily intimidate their way inside the Ellard household, where the parents told them everything (see victim2 entry). They also  salvaged two hard drives, and some pills. Afterwards, Zeferet went to the Haven and Cedric joined up with the morgue crew.\nMax was missing, but they decided to proceed anyway. They managed to get in with Doctor Sam, who left them to investigate. Investigations of the bodies revealed post-mortem damage perhaps designed to look like a crime of passion amongst other thing (see victim entries). They retrieved the victim’s personal belongings, including phones, wallets and a Rolex watch. Near the end they were joined by Cedric. \nIn the meantime, Max had had trouble dealing with his hunger.   He satiated himself on an elderly lady, but entered Hunger frenzy, savagely tearing her up (Hunger 0). Through Willpower he steer himself to the sewers, going on a rampage. Regaining his senses, he went to clean up the mess, contacting De Luca. Hiding it so far, and dissoving the body by experimentation, he leaves De Luca to finish up. \nAt the haven the coterie is less than pleased with Max, who still smells of sewer. However, the younglings get distracted by another smell of cat. The Ceilicans finally reveal themselves, and, in short, ask them to stay out of their territory/business, and mentions the Detective “needs to be dealt with”. The Ceilican, calling herself Cheshire, dissapears with a smile. \nThey get a call from the Detective about a 3rd Victim found in an abandoned building. This time they can be first at the scene. \nSession ends by informing Mr. Matthews and setting up a gallery tour the next night (for coterie& +1's)","name":"Set Embed Description"},{"storage":"2","varName":"Session3","channel":"0","varName2":"","name":"Send Embed Message"}]},{"name":"Session4","permissions":"NONE","restriction":"1","actions":[{"title":"**#3: The Third Victim**","author":"","color":"#ffa600","timestamp":"false","url":"","authorIcon":"","imageUrl":"","thumbUrl":"","storage":"2","varName":"Sessio4","name":"Create Embed Message"},{"storage":"2","varName":"Session4","message":"**Yield:** ?xp\n**Gametime:** \n**Session time:** \n**People Encountered:** ","name":"Set Embed Description"},{"storage":"2","varName":"Session4","channel":"0","varName2":"","name":"Send Embed Message"}]},{"name":"Cheshire","permissions":"NONE","restriction":"1","actions":[{"title":"**Cheshire**","author":"","color":"#0060eb","timestamp":"false","url":"","authorIcon":"","imageUrl":"","thumbUrl":"","storage":"2","varName":"Cheshire","name":"Create Embed Message"},{"storage":"2","varName":"Cheshire","message":"**Name:**         Cheshire?\n**Title(s)**      ???\n**Race:**         Ceilican (Werecat)\n**Description:**\nThe coterie have only seen her (feminie mental voice) in her cat form.
